Web scraping using Kofax RPA

# About Project

An Web Scrapping RPA robot designed using the Kofax RPA program, which, by entering only the URL of the desired restaurant from yemeksepeti.com, retrieves the menu of that restaurant and saves it to a database.

# What is RPA?
RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation. It refers to the use of software robots or "bots" to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks within business processes. RPA technology aims to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and enhance operational efficiency by allowing these software robots to perform tasks that were traditionally carried out by humans.

# How can RPA be used in data science and web scraping projects?

RPA (Robotic Process Automation) can be highly beneficial in data science and web scraping projects by automating processes in data retrieval and extraction. Here are some examples of how RPA can be utilized in data science and web scraping projects:

**Data Collection and Cleansing:** RPA can be employed to automatically extract data from specific websites and subsequently clean this data. For instance, RPA can be used to automatically fetch and organize financial data or market prices from various sources.

**Data Integration:** RPA can automate the process of gathering data from diverse sources and integrating them. For example, it can collect data from multiple websites and consolidate them into a single database.

**Scheduling and Timing Analysis:** RPA can be used when data needs to be retrieved or analyzed at regular intervals. For instance, it can automatically fetch social media interactions every hour or monitor product prices on an e-commerce site at regular intervals.

**Web Scraping and Data Extraction:** RPA is useful for extracting data from specific websites or portals. Especially in data scraping projects, RPA can automate data extraction, making the process more efficient and speedy.

**Automating Data Analysis:** RPA can be used to automate specific data analysis processes. For example, it can automatically perform analysis and generate reports when new data arrives.

**Error Correction and Retry:** Errors can occur during data extraction or processing. RPA can automatically detect errors, correct them, and reprocess data if needed.

In conclusion, RPA serves as a valuable tool in automating processes, retrieving and integrating data, performing timing analysis, and automating data analysis in data science and web scraping projects. This enables obtaining results more quickly, efficiently, and reliably.
